# Iterators & Generators
## Iterators
So what do we mean by Iterator? What is this pattern?
    - Well basically whenever you have some data source, doesn't have to be a DB, can just be a value like an array.
    - anything that is a datasource, if you would like to consume the values in that data source one at a time, one of the most common ways to do that is called the _iterator pattern_.
    - Essentially you construct a controller that gives you a view of that data source and it presents values on value at a time.
        - You do that by constructing an object and then calling `.next`over and over and every time you call `.next`, you get back the next value from that data source.
